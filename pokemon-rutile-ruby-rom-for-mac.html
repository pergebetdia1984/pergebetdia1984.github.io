Their main purpose is to provide a more challenging game experience while not artificially limiting the player. The premier feature of Rutile Ruby and Star Sapphire is the ground-up redesign of Pokémon Trainers in the world to increase the game's challenge. Every trainer in the game has been edited, and the level curve expects use of the Experience Share, which means that you level up very quickly. You should be hitting Level 100 by the time you get to the Elite Four.<br />The secondary focus of RR/SS is to function as a sort of '20XX Hack Pack' where everything obtainable is 100% legal for real online battles, and some features are designed to make preparing competitive teams much less of a hassle<br />As of Version 2.0, there are three builds available of RR/SS! They only differ in Wild Pokémon availability:<br />Legit Build: All Wild Pokémon are 100% legit for trade and will not appear as 'hacked' by any legitimacy testers. Post-game foreign Pokémon are unlocked from the start, and rarities and Hordes are adjusted.<br />Leveled Build: Wild Pokémon are the same as in the Legit Build, but are leveled up to keep pace with RR/SS's harsh level curve. A quick adjustment in PKHeX (editing Met Level) will make them 100% legit.<br />679 Build: Wild Pokémon are altered so that every non-Legendary non-Starter species is available, at the same level as the Leveled Build. Legendary encounters are not changed in this or any Build. Click here for the list of altered encounter tables.</p><p>Trainer Changes</p><p>Harsher Level Curve: Balanced to the EXP Share!<br />All-New Trainer teams, many featuring six Pokémon! Even the rematches have been edited!<br />All Gym Leaders have six Pokémon!<br />Trainers throughout the game have access to Mega Evolution!<br />Alternate Battle Types are more common in the world!</p><p>The level curve is drastically steeper. The game is balanced around use of the EXP Share, which allows for explosive growth. For example, the average level for Wattson’s team is Lv41. The player is expected to hit Level 100 at around the eighth Gym badge. Disabling the EXP share is not recommended.<br />While grinding is always possible, the curve is such that you’ll be approximately even with (or slightly under) all enemy levels if you complete the optional content such as side routes. If you skip fights, you'll probably be underleveled!<br />Conversely, you might find yourself overleveled if you use the Lucky Egg, Experience Gain O-Powers, and/or the Trade Bonus.<br />All trainers’ teams have been changed to provide greater challenge. This isn’t just a global “level buff”, each team was individually created. They often have very different Pokémon than in OR/AS. Rematches have also been completely changed, with all Rematch trainers eventually getting six Pokémon.<br />All Gym Leaders have six Pokémon. Starting with Wattson, they also each have a Mega Evolution.<br />Trainers battled throughout the game might also have Mega Evolutions.<br />Double Battles are more common in the world.<br />Rotation, Triple, and Horde Trainer battles are found in the world.<br />Throughout the course of the game, you’ll see every fully-evolved Pokémon in the teams of enemy trainers. You’ll also see every Mega Evolution.<br />Since you can’t just rely on being overleveled, it is recommended to EV train your team using Super Training or Horde Training. The hack makes it easier to do these methods in the early game.</p><p>Wild Pokémon Changes</p><img src='https://www.cpokemon.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/neo-x-neo-y.png' alt='Pokemon ruby red rom' title='Pokemon ruby red rom' /><p>Post-game Foreign Pokémon are available from the beginning of the game!<br />Rarity within areas adjusted<br />Hordes optimized for painless and early EV training!<br />Lots more Wild Hold Items!<br />Everything caught in the Legit Build is 100% legit for trade!<br />Pokémon caught in the Leveled Build just need a Met Level adjustment to become 100% legit!<br />Almost every Pokémon is available in the 679 Build! The only ones missing are the Kanto and Kalos starters and any legendaries not available in OR/AS.</p><p>In the Legit and Leveled Builds, wild encounters for each map are the ones usually unlocked post-game. You won’t need the DexNav to find them.<br />Anything caught within the Legit Build is completely legitimate and trade-ready.

Their main purpose is to provide a more challenging game experience while not artificially limiting the player. The premier feature of Rutile Ruby and Star Sapphire is the ground-up redesign of Pokémon Trainers in the world to increase the game's challenge. Every trainer in the game has been edited, and the level curve expects use of the Experience Share, which means that you level up very quickly. You should be hitting Level 100 by the time you get to the Elite Four.<br />The secondary focus of RR/SS is to function as a sort of '20XX Hack Pack' where everything obtainable is 100% legal for real online battles, and some features are designed to make preparing competitive teams much less of a hassle<br />As of Version 2.0, there are three builds available of RR/SS! They only differ in Wild Pokémon availability:<br />Legit Build: All Wild Pokémon are 100% legit for trade and will not appear as 'hacked' by any legitimacy testers. Post-game foreign Pokémon are unlocked from the start, and rarities and Hordes are adjusted.<br />Leveled Build: Wild Pokémon are the same as in the Legit Build, but are leveled up to keep pace with RR/SS's harsh level curve. A quick adjustment in PKHeX (editing Met Level) will make them 100% legit.<br />679 Build: Wild Pokémon are altered so that every non-Legendary non-Starter species is available, at the same level as the Leveled Build. Legendary encounters are not changed in this or any Build. Click here for the list of altered encounter tables.</p><p>Trainer Changes</p><p>Harsher Level Curve: Balanced to the EXP Share!<br />All-New Trainer teams, many featuring six Pokémon! Even the rematches have been edited!<br />All Gym Leaders have six Pokémon!<br />Trainers throughout the game have access to Mega Evolution!<br />Alternate Battle Types are more common in the world!</p><p>The level curve is drastically steeper. The game is balanced around use of the EXP Share, which allows for explosive growth. For example, the average level for Wattson’s team is Lv41. The player is expected to hit Level 100 at around the eighth Gym badge. Disabling the EXP share is not recommended.<br />While grinding is always possible, the curve is such that you’ll be approximately even with (or slightly under) all enemy levels if you complete the optional content such as side routes. If you skip fights, you'll probably be underleveled!<br />Conversely, you might find yourself overleveled if you use the Lucky Egg, Experience Gain O-Powers, and/or the Trade Bonus.<br />All trainers’ teams have been changed to provide greater challenge. This isn’t just a global “level buff”, each team was individually created. They often have very different Pokémon than in OR/AS. Rematches have also been completely changed, with all Rematch trainers eventually getting six Pokémon.<br />All Gym Leaders have six Pokémon. Starting with Wattson, they also each have a Mega Evolution.<br />Trainers battled throughout the game might also have Mega Evolutions.<br />Double Battles are more common in the world.<br />Rotation, Triple, and Horde Trainer battles are found in the world.<br />Throughout the course of the game, you’ll see every fully-evolved Pokémon in the teams of enemy trainers. You’ll also see every Mega Evolution.<br />Since you can’t just rely on being overleveled, it is recommended to EV train your team using Super Training or Horde Training. The hack makes it easier to do these methods in the early game.</p><p>Wild Pokémon Changes</p><p>Post-game Foreign Pokémon are available from the beginning of the game!<br />Rarity within areas adjusted<br />Hordes optimized for painless and early EV training!<br />Lots more Wild Hold Items!<br />Everything caught in the Legit Build is 100% legit for trade!<br />Pokémon caught in the Leveled Build just need a Met Level adjustment to become 100% legit!<br />Almost every Pokémon is available in the 679 Build! The only ones missing are the Kanto and Kalos starters and any legendaries not available in OR/AS.</p><p>In the Legit and Leveled Builds, wild encounters for each map are the ones usually unlocked post-game. You won’t need the DexNav to find them.<br />Anything caught within the Legit Build is completely legitimate and trade-ready. Anything caught in the Leveled Build just needs a quick touch-up in PKHeX to become trade-ready.<br />Pokémon Locations in the 649 Build are available here.<br />Naturally “rarer” species in areas have had their rarity adjusted.
